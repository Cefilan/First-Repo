# First-Repo

Yaow people, whatsup?

I'm L and am interested in anything with codes,
i would like to learn java, python , html etc but i'm a rookie.
I've had some studies but i'd rather perfection it instead of doing stuff half assed.

Give a fuckness : Lvl 0 

i'd be down for all the feature help,

Best regards
